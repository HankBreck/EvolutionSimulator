# EvolutionSimulator

This program simulates natural selection in nature using a genetic algorithm. Four sets of fitness functions are programmed into the code. These are 'calc_fitnessT1', 'calc_fitnessT2', 'calc_fitnessT3', 'calc_fitnessT4', and 'calc_fitnessT5'. These represent the different variations of the independent variable (environment order) in the lab experiment.

This code runs the program 10 times using the 'average_all' function. This is necessary because the program tends to favor 1 attribute to rapidly increase to increase the fitness score. We must repeat the process multiple times to eliminate this random error and insure that all attributes are represented.

Comments are made throughout the code to clarify anything that could be confusing.
